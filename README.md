// Unity Learn Program's third Prototype Project being a fast-paced endless side-scrolling runner game that reminds Temple Run in a sort.

In this Unit, I programmed different scripts for a game where the player needs to time jumps over oncoming obstacles to avoid crashing. While creating this prototype, I got more experience with adding music and sound effects and also how to create dynamic endless repeating backgrounds, which are critical for any side-scrolling games.
Skills Practiced:
Application scripting
Write code that utilizes the various Unity APIs
Prototype new concepts
Debugging
Diagnose and fix code that compiles, but fails to perform as expected
Diagnose and fix common compilation errors
Diagnose and fix the cause of an exception
